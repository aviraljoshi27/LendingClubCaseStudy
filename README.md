# Lending Club Case Study
> The company, as the largest online loan marketplace, seeks to minimize financial losses caused by loan defaults (credit loss). Loan applicants classified as 'charged-off' represent defaulters, leading to significant monetary losses. To address this, the company aims to identify the key factors (driver variables) influencing loan defaults.

> By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), the objective is to identify risky loan applicants and uncover strong predictors of default. Insights from this analysis will assist the company in making informed decisions for portfolio and risk assessment, ultimately reducing credit loss and improving operational efficiency.

## General Information
- This project aims to help an online loan marketplace reduce financial losses caused by loan defaults. By analyzing historical loan data through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project seeks to identify key factors that indicate a borrower's likelihood to default. These insights will assist the company in improving risk assessment, minimizing credit losses, and optimizing loan portfolio management.
 
- The project focuses on minimizing credit losses for an online loan marketplace by identifying key factors leading to loan defaults. Using historical data and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the aim is to recognize high-risk loan applicants, improve risk assessment, and optimize portfolio management to reduce financial losses.
 
- The business problem this project aims to solve is the minimization of credit losses by identifying risky loan applicants who are likely to default. Loan defaults significantly impact the company's profitability, and understanding the key factors that lead to defaults will enable the company to better assess risk, reduce the issuance of high-risk loans, and improve overall portfolio performance. This will enhance financial stability and operational efficiency while maintaining competitive interest rates for borrowers.

- Purpose of Loan: Loans taken specifically for debt consolidation.

- Loan Amount: Borrowers seeking loans of less than $30,000.

- Loan Grade: Loans with a grade equal to or above the mid-tier (e.g., E or higher).

- Interest Rate: Loans with interest rates exceeding 15%, reflecting prior credit challenges.
